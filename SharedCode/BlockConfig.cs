	/// <summary>
	/// The idea is that a BlockConfig contains all of the configuration information that
	/// BlockHead needs to take a block (well, almost. It doesn't contain mappings to 
	/// physical channels at the minute). The config is serialized inside the block so that,
	/// in principle, the analysis code can analyse against any parameter.
	/// 
	/// The switching channels are stored as Modulations. There are currently three types of
	/// modulation: digital, analog and timing (not implemented yet). This distinction is primarily
	/// for the benefit of the analysis code. See BlockHead for how these channels are mapped to
	/// switches in the lab (maybe an example would help clear this up - there is a difference
	/// between what the modulation does and how it's implemented. Take the B step. It's an
	/// analog modulation as it modulates an analog quantity (the current) however in the lab
	/// the actual modulation is produced by a box which is fed a ttl signal, so it's mapped in
	/// blockhead to a TTLSwitchChannel. Make sense ?)
