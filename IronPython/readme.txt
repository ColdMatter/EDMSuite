The zip file contains the source files for the custom version of IronPython used to power the scripting. It's a custom version because IPy kept on changing, so we got stuck on 1.1.2, but this version is not compatible with any recent version of the .NET framework. So, the version in the zip is stock 1.1.2 with the minimum changes to get it to compile on .NET 4 (at time of writing, 07/12/11).
